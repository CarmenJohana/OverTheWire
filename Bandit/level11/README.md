# Preliminaries

In this level, we are told that the password is generated by rotating all the letters in data.txt by 13 positions (a ROT13 cipher).

# Commands Used

First, I displayed the contents of the file using *cat data.txt*.

The output was *Gur cnffjbeq vf 7k16JArUVv5LxVuJfsSVdbbtaHGlw9D4*.
This looked like an encoded string. Recognizing the pattern, I suspected it was encoded using a ROT13 substitution cipher, where each letter of the alphabet is shifted by 13 positions.

To solve this, I needed a command that could replace or rotate characters. I searched the manual pages with:

man -k "change" "characters"

Among the results, I found:

*tr (1) - translate or delete characters*

The tr command is useful for replacing characters. For example, *echo "i am a boy" | tr "a" "n"* produces *i nm n boy*

Extending this concept, ROT13 can be applied by rotating all letters of the alphabet by 13 positions. This can be achieved with:

*cat data.txt | tr 'a-zA-Z' 'n-za-mN-ZA-M'*

This command substitutes each character with its ROT13 equivalent, decoding the hidden message.

# Result

The password for the next level is:
